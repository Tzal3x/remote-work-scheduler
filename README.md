# Remote work scheduler üë®‚Äçüíªüè†

Let's say you are working in the human resources department in a company that hybrid remote work is the status quo, and you need to create a weekly schedule for the employees.

The aim is to **define which days of the week each employee has to come in the office**, taking into account a set of constraints (e.g. all members of a team should have the same schedule, in order to meet at the office the same days, each employee should work from home 3 days a week etc).

This is what this script is doing, created as a proof of concept with some artificial constraints and data.

The output can also be exported to a csv file in order to be loaded in your favorite excel-like editor.

# Brief theory

Since all we care for in this problem is whether a solution is feasible or not given our set of constraints, this problem can be classified into the [constraint programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_programming) category. 

Google has a very convenient solver, the [CP-SAT Solver](https://developers.google.com/optimization/cp/cp_solver) from the or-tools library for those kinds of problems. 

All that I had to do was to create the correct model in order to feed it to the solver.

## The model 

First step to construct our model, is to define our variables:

- Let `wfh_X_Y` be **1** if _the employee with name X is working from home the day Y_, else 0. 
e.g. `wfh_Alex_friday` == "Alex is working from home on Friday". 

Then we add constraints to the `cp_model.CpModel()` by expressing those constraints in relation to those variables: 

**Constraints**:

1. Each employee should work **n** days from home per week, where `0 < n <= 5`

2. The number of employees in office should not be less than **m**, where `0 < m <= total_number_of_employees`

3. The number of employees in office should not exceed **M**, where `0 < M <= total_number_of_employees`

4. Every employee of the same team should have the same schedule.

5. Other requests or exceptions such as: "Team 1 should be in office on Mondays", "Employee 41 is always working from office" etc.

From that point on, to express those constraints in a language that the model can understand, we write the equations as sums of the variables `wfh_X_Y`.

For example constraint 1 can be expressed as:

```python
for name in employees:
    if not has_special_request(name):
        model.Add(sum(wfh[(name, d)] for d in days) == n)
```
