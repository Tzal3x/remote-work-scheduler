# Remote work scheduler 👨‍💻🏠

Let's say you are working in the human resources department in a company that hybrid remote work is the status quo, and you need to create a weekly schedule for the employees.

The aim is to **define which days of the week each employee has to come in the office**, taking into account a set of constraints (e.g. all members of a team should have the same schedule, in order to meet at the office the same days, each employee should work from home 3 days a week etc).

This is what this script is doing, created as a proof of concept with some artificial constraints and data. Output can also be exported to a csv file in order to be loaded in your favorite excel-like editor.
